# miniToast
**Just another js lib to display small popup messages, using only javascript**

## Why?

In my search for a very simple lib to just display notifications, I got frustrated with the current standing.
Turns out we either need to pay the jQuery tax to make this work, or include hundreds of obsolete lines to display a simple toast-like message.
So I decided I would make a small tradeoff, less functionality (removing some of the stuff I wouldnt have used anyway), for less code, and thus, faster page loads and less stuff laying around.

## So What?

Well, if you feel like loading jQuery, a notification library, 10 other jQuery plugins, 950kb background images, and who knows what else, do it. That is your right.
I just want to display a simple notification. I dont want it to tween and then tell me the current distance to Mars while also brewing me coffee.
So thats what, if you don't want this, move on.
